Probability

Random variable:
Discrete: A discrete random variable has a finite or countably number of states. in others words, it is not posible to take a value or state between two consecutive . For example: number of children.
Continnuous: A discrete random variable has infinite values,then it is posible two take a state between two consecutive (interval). For example , Time that you spend to play a game.

Probability distributions:

The probability distributions is a function that describes the probability of obtaining the possible values on each of its posible states. In other words, it describe the behaviour of a random variable.
