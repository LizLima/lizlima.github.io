<h2>Liz Lima</h2>
Master's student in computer science

<b>Biography</b>

I am a fellow of the Master's program in computer science funded by <b>Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología (CONCYTEC)</b> y de <b>CIENCIACTIVA</b>.  Source: <a href="http://rics.ucsp.edu.pe/mcs/#presentacion">UCSP</a>

My B.Eng. degree in "Ingeniería de Sistemas" at San Agustin National University - Arequipa - Peru

My research interest is learning algorithms in image processing Machine learning , Computer vision and Image Processing.

<b>Interests and Activities</b>
Now I am working on my master's thesis proposal. My research focuses on the face frontalization non-frontal face image using GAN's(Generative adversarial network). The idea is to get more realistic frontal face images to try to improve face recognition in images that get under unconstrained conditions(real-world).
The main problem in the face recognition task is the position of the face. For this reason, I intend to use a GAN to produce a synthesized frontal-face image from a non-frontal image.
