Autoencoder is a neural network that aims to generate a copy of the input to the output. The autoencoder has two part. It compress the input in a code that is used as representation of the input into a laten space representations. 
<br>Autoencoder has two parts:
<ul>
  <li>Encoder: It is the part of the autoencoder that compress the input into a laten space. It may be represented by a function f </li>
  <li>Decoder</li>
</ul>
