The <a href='http://jmlr.org/papers/volume9/vandermaaten08a/vandermaaten08a.pdf'>original paper</a> describes the working of t-SNE as:

“t-Distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) minimizes the divergence between two distributions: a distribution that measures pairwise similarities of the input objects and a distribution that measures pairwise similarities of the corresponding low-dimensional points in the embedding”.
